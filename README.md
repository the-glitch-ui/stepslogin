## General info

Multi-step login in React which includes validation and UI animations in CSS.
This project's UI has inspiration in the vanilla Javascript tutorial by [(Dev Ed)](https://developedbyed.com/).
After finishing it, I decided to rebuild it from scratch as a personal exercise, using my own knowledge in React + ES6+ and adding some additional functionalities.
